                He sat alone in their regular boot staring at his drink still full. 
                He watched as his best friend Dude and best female friend Gal were fighting over who gets to have their name put in the menu. 
                Dude had come up with the combination.
                But Gal ordered it every time she went there (which was quite often).
                Due to her loyalty to the meal, the restaurant honored her by giving it her name.
                Upset about this, Dude tried messing with Gal.
                When Dude did get the chance to get his name on multiple dishes, he failed and gave up.
                He accepted Gal's win.

                Then came in Guy and invited Man to a game of Monster Trucks vs Transformers. 
                Man, once amused about the idea, rejected it. 
                Guy is not taking "no" for an answer and so he proceeds to convince Man on going.
            </p>
                <blockquote>Man, this is gonna be AWESOME. 
                You know what I do when I am not sure whether to do something or not? 
                I just ask future me if he enjoyed it.
                Let him make the choice.
                Look, close your eyes, count to 5, and... open them.</blockquote> 
            <p>
                Man skeptical of Guy, did what he asked and when he opened his eyes, he was shocked to see that there was the 20 years later him. 
                Just like his friend had asked, Man asked his future self whether he should go to the event. 
                The future version of himself says yes and as he gets up and ready to go, the  
                20 hours later version comes in to stop him. Man confused asks why
                the 20 hours later version showed up. He tells him not to go because he would
                get wasted and feel awful the following day.
                There he was with 2 separate versions of himself, both contradicting
                each other. What was he going to do? 
            </p>
            <p>
                He closes his eyes once again and realizes it was all a dream. He had imagined the fight between Dude and Gal.
                He was at the boot staring at tickets to go watch Monster Trucks vs Transformers. 
                He is alone. He realized that for most of his life, he's been thinking 
                about himself and his future even when his friends were there. His 
                friends were all messed up but now that they have found their way
                he is the only one lost. He let the good times go and what does he 
                have now? Nothing
