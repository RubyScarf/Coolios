                He sat alone in their regular boot staring at his drink still full. 
                His friend comes in and invites him to a game of Robots vs Wrestlers. 
                The man once amused about the idea rejects it. The friend tells the 
                man, 
            </p>
                <blockquote>Man, this is gonna be AWESOME. If you are uncertain 
                about it just ask the future you if he enjoyed it. Look, close your 
                eyes, and... open them.</blockquote> 
            <p>
                The man opened his eyes and was shocked to see that there was the 
                20 years later version of himself. Just like his friend had asked the
                man asked his future self whether he should go to the event. The future
                version of himself says yes and as he gets up and read to go, the  
                20 hours later version comes in to stop him. The man confused asks why
                the 20 hours version is there. He tells him not to go because he would
                get wasted and feel awful about it. 
                There he was with 2 separate versions of himself, both contradicting
                each other. What was he going to do? 
            </p>
            <p>
                He closes his eyes once again and realizes it was all a dream. He
                was at the boot staring at tickets to go watch Robots vs Wrestlers. 
                He is alone. He realized that for most of his life, he's been thinking 
                about himself and his future even when his friends were there. His 
                friends were all messed up but now that they have found their way
                he is the only one lost. He let the good times go and what does he 
                have now? Nothing
