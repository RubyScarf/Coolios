          I've watched Frozen 2 once a day for 150+ days in a row. 
        </h2>
        <p>
          Frozen 2 came out in November 22nd, 2019. I had always loved and enjoyed Frozen <br>
          the first movie which came out in November 27, 2013. Never really been a fan of <br>
          princesses but <em>man</em> a queen who has ice powers, thats cool. Frozen 2 <br>
          brought me back to 7yo me singing Let It Go. Now that I'm older and I can actually <br>
          do the research, people like Kristen Bell (Anna's Voice) and Idina Menzel (Elsa's <br>
          Voice) have made the movie much more special.
