          Our soccer team started a bit rough. We were trying to find ourselves as a team. <br>
          Even with the weak beginning, Mr. Yee, put faith on us and we started improving. <br>
          We started winning some games and had less and less losses. We eventually had no <br>
          losses and we won the <strong>championship!</strong>
